    <string name="text_1">Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages.
        The Android SDK tools compile your code along with any data and resource files into an APK,
        an Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix. One APK file contains all
        the contents of an Android app and is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.
        Each Android app lives in its own security sandbox, protected by the following Android security features:
        The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.
        By default, the system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID (the ID is used only by the
        system and is unknown to the app). The system sets permissions for all the files in an app
        so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.
        Each process has its own virtual machine (VM), so an app\'s code runs in isolation from other apps.
        By default, every app runs in its own Linux process. The Android system starts the process
        when any of the app\'s components need to be executed, and then shuts down the process
        when it\'s no longer needed or when the system must recover memory for other apps.</string>
    <string name="text_2">The Android system implements the principle of least privilege. That is,
        each app, by default, has access only to the components that it requires to do its work
        and no more. This creates a very secure environment in which an app cannot access parts of
        the system for which it is not given permission. However, there are ways for an app to share
        data with other apps and for an app to access system services:
        It\'s possible to arrange for two apps to share the same Linux user ID, in which case they
        are able to access each other\'s files. To conserve system resources, apps with the same
        user ID can also arrange to run in the same Linux process and share the same VM. The apps
        must also be signed with the same certificate.
        An app can request permission to access device data such as the user\'s contacts, SMS messages,
        the mountable storage (SD card), camera, and Bluetooth. The user has to explicitly grant
        these permissions. For more information, see Working with System Permissions.</string>
    <string name="text_3">The rest of this document introduces the following concepts:
        The core framework components that define your app.
        The manifest file in which you declare the components and the required device features for your app.
        Resources that are separate from the app code and that allow your app to gracefully optimize
        its behavior for a variety of device configurations.</string>
